# Overview
<p>HuTao is small bot created by a video game programer and genshin impact enthusiast to help her discord server. At the moment the 1.1 version is released, HuTao can't be added to your server because of the lack of tutorial to include it correctly and missing functionnalities and hard coded functionalities. 

HuTao is a discord bot that have multiple functionnalities :
• Role assigner - Need something that can assign mulitple roles for your server ? I've got you covered ! Hu Tao can post a message on a designated channel to list the available roles and assign a role to a user who react to the message with the chosen emoji (customized or not).

• Genshin Impact daily connection reminder - Connect to Hoyolab everyday to get primogems, moras, weapon crystals and food for your game. The bot is able to send you a message everyday at 8pm (server local time) to remind you that you have to check-in for the daily connection. The message have a clickable link that will guide you to the connection page so that you won't have to search for the link, very useful !

• Epic Games weekly reminder - Every week, the Epic Games Store is offering a free game for a week to everyone who owns an account on their shop. To stop forgetting about claiming your game, you can add this bot to your server to get a reminder every thursday at 5pm. Like the genshin reminder, the reminder have a direct link to the Epic Games store on the posted message so that you don't have to search for the link.

• Prime gaming monthly reminder - Every month, Prime Gaming is offering in-game contents and free games to all Amazon Prime subscribers, to not miss any rewards, the HuTao bot can send you monthly reminder every 15th of the month to go fetch your rewards on the Prime gaming website.

• Birthday reminder - Don't forget about the birthdays of your members thanks to this bot ! Every day, the bot will check if today is the birthday of one or multiple members of your server and post a message if that's the case. *Available in 2.0 version*

• Music bot - Want to listen to music while your in vocal with your friends ? HuTao can do this for you. Use the music commands to play, pause, stop, forward to the next song and add a music to the playing queue. *Available in 2.0 version*</p>


# Installation
<p>HuTao is small bot created by a video game programer and genshin impact enthusiast to help her discord server. At the moment the 1.1 version is released, HuTao can't be added to your server because of the current state of the code that include hard coding of some functionalities, the lack of a tutorial to include it, and missing functionalities. 

To install HuTao on your server, you'll need a server or a computer that will be powered 24/7 to act as a server. You'll also need to activate the <a href="https://techswift.org/2020/09/17/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-discord/">developper mode of discord</a>.

**Installation process will be fully written once the bot will be able to installed elsewhere.** If you're interested, you know at least what you'll need to install it on your discord server. </p>

# Disclaimer
<p>HuTao is small bot created by a video game programer and genshin impact enthusiast to help her discord server. I don't promise regular updates as I made this project for fun, I can't promise to add what you want because I add in priority what my guild needs and what's in my programming capacities. This may stop receving updates at any moments by a lack of time or not wanting to add anything else.

~~By this time, the major problem of this project is <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1">the discord API library used as discord.py isn't supported anymore</a> so I'll have to migrate my full project on another discord API library who uses Python3 as soon as possible in order to still get an updated library. Migrating this project to javascript isn't an option for me.</p>~~ Discord.py have decided to pursue the developpment of the library so this isn't my main issue anymore, moreover, this project have already migrated to Discord.py 2.0.
